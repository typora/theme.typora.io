> *Designed and tested on arch linux. Not fully tested, but should work for Windows/Mac OS. This theme only contains styles for the document, **not** the user interface.*

This theme was born out of a need to create a beautiful printed file with MathJax math, code blocks, and flowcharts.

* Font settings:
  * Default is Noto Serif
  * Monospaced is `Inconsolata`
  * The font size is 12px
  * Double spaced default
* Any mermaid chart generated will automatically resize its width to the width of the Parent container
  * Which is the width of the window you view it in minus 60px for the left and right side padding of Typora
* Print settings:
  * All paragraphs are set to avoid being split up when printing
  * All headers are set to make a page break before themselves when printing
  * All mermaid diagrams are set to avoid being split up when printing
* All headings greater than heading 2 do not have a line underneath them, whereas heading 1 and heading 2 have a line underneath them by default

All the rest derives from the default github theme!
