# typora-theme-redrail

English | [简体中文](./README_CN.md)
# Origin
The 'RedRail' theme inspired by the theme of the Minority Style，which perform well in the `pie` and `ursine` themes. Among the various Typora themes, the Minority Style uses a striking and refreshing red color as its base tone, which makes coding and note-taking more enjoyable and relaxed. Also, use light themes during the day to make your notes clear, and dark themes at night to make your notes comfortable. Here are a few sources of inspiration, thank you in advance.
- [pie](https://github.com/shrugginG/typora-theme-pie) theme
- [ursine](https://github.com/danielduyixin/typora-theme-ursine) theme
- Zhang Jin's modifications of the `pie` theme and `ursine` theme

If you like this theme, please praise a star, thank you for your attention！
