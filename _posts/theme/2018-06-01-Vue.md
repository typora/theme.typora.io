## Themes Forked From it...

[**downgoon**](/fork/downgoon/) (/daʊn'gʊn/) This theme was born out of a need to **quickly look at the targeting section** in the whole document with **numbered headlines marked by highlight bar**. It is useful and convenient when you share and discuss with other members of your team especially in a remote meeting.
