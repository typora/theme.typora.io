<h1 align="center">GitHub Dark Themes for Typora</h1>

<p align="center">Typora themes based on GitHub Dark Default, Dark Dimmed, and Dark High-Contrast</p>

<br>

These themes were initially created by [Kinoute](https://github.com/kinoute/typora-github-night-theme), but have since been enhanced to provide a more authentic GitHub experience. For example, they now use the system fonts instead of Nunito, as GitHub does. In addition, several other improvements have been made, such as enhanced code block border-radius, colors, list spacing, text line height, font weight, and checkboxes, among others.

Designed and tested on macOS. Not fully tested, but should work for Windows/Linux.
