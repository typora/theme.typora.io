# typora-fro

A Typora theme used almostly the same style as my [blog site](https://fro-blo.com). (Feel free to visit!)

Some design are inspired by the default theme of [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

> [!caution]
> Designed and tested on macOS. Not fully tested, but should work for Windows/Linux.

> [!note]
>
> This theme currently is designed for **Light Mode**. Be careful when choosing it in dark environment.
