A theme aimed at reading long texts avoiding distractions. This goal is achieved:
- Removing blank space. Compact makes little use of blank lines to separate items. It only adds blank lines around blockquotes, code blocks, tables and headings `<h1>` thru `<h4>`. Paragraphs are discerned by indentation. This scarce usage of blank space and a constant inter-line distance gives Compact its name.
- Avoiding distractions:
  - Compact does little use of colour. Only code blocks, links and highlights use colour. 
  - The same can be said about graphical items as lines, they are only used in tables, code blocks —only when displaying line numbers— and HTML `<kbd>` tags.

This overall scarcity of ornament gives Compact a someway sober or austere look, but it is a nice theme to keep your attention on long texts avoiding disturbances. It was designed to look like classical or vintage printed books.
