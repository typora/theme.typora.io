# Eloquent

## About
Eloquent is a Typora theme designed for writing technical books. It's minimal and easy to use!

Eloquent was created and tested on Linux, but it hasn't been tested in macOS or Windows yet.

## Installation
Install Typora on your operating system using the instructions [here](https://typora.io/), and then download the latest release of this theme [here](https://github.com/jianmin-chen/eloquent/releases), which should be a ZIP file named as `eloquent.zip`. Extract this folder to Typora's theme folder, which can be found by opening Typora and going to File > Preferences > Appearance. Once you have the ZIP extracted, simply go into the folder containing the theme(i.e, `eloquent`), and pull out `eloquent.css` into the parent directory. Open Typora again, and you should be able to change the theme to Eloquent.

## Usage
Once you have the theme running, simply start writing in Markdown! A good starter guide to Markdown can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
