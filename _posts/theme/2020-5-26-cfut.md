# cfut Theme for Typora

As a Mathematics student,the most commonly used block is math block ,so I write a theme to do some styling for the math block ,may be it is the best theme for my eyes ,welcome to give me advice and use my theme to make better themes.

For export pdf ,the shadow is a little bit strange,so I write cfut1 to cancel the shadow,so,if you want to export pdf document ,please use cfut1 .

This theme is based on github theme ,and learn from lots of theme for typora.



This theme had been tested under `Windows` System.
